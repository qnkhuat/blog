__TL;DR__ : Electric cars are __5__ times more efficient than fossil fuel powered cars.


Terms : 
- Electric cars : Cars powered by 100% electric.
- Hybrid cars : Cars powered by both electric and fossil fuels (__Gas__ or __Diesel__).
- Combustion engine cars : Cars powered by fossil fuels.
- L/100km : the unit of measurement for how many liters of fuel a car consumes to travel 100km. We'll use this number a lot to compare the efficiency of cars.

__Let's start with some fact checks__

The chart above shows the 3 most fuel-efficient cars each for 3 fuel types: Electric, Hybird and Gas in 2019 [(1)](#1).

The Mitsubishi Mirage are the king of Combustion Engine car which consumes 6 L/100km - 3.5 times higher than the Tesla Model 3 which consumes 1.7 L/100km.

Even with the hybrid Toyora Prius which are very popular in the US consumes 4.2 L/100km.

__How about the whole industry?__[(2)](#2).

    height="525" width="100%"></iframe>

As of 2020, The Combusion Engine Cars Industry consumes 10.88 L/100km on average - __5__ times higher than the Electric Cars Industry which consumes 2.29 L/100km.

Let's not forget the Combustion Engine Cars Industry has more than 100 years of production experienced since the successful Ford Model T in 1908, And the first highway legal Electric Cars was the Tesla Roadster developed in 2004.
# How do Electric cars achieve this efficiency?
In order to answer this question we need to understand how a car consume energy?
- Energy conversion
- Power to wheels
- Auxiliary systems

## Energy conversion
Whenever we talk about energy, we need to remember the Law of conservation of energy : 
> Energy can neither be created nor destroyed; rather, it can only be transformed or transferred from one form to another.

We care about this because we need to know how much energy has been wasted to convert energy from gasoline or electric to the actual energy that push our car to move.

For comparision we need to measure the conversion rate

$$\eta_{e} = {E_{out} \over E_{in}}$$

In which $$E_{out}$$ are the actual energy that push our car to move. Or in physics, we call it kinetic energy.

$$E_{in}$$ are the energy that we input to the car. For combustion engine cars It's gasoline/Dielse. For electric cars it's, well, Electric.

    <figcaption style='text-align:center; font-size:13px; color:gray;'>Illustration of how greenhouse effect works</figcaption>
</figure>
This rate reflect how well the cars use the input energy, for example if $$\eta_{e} = 100\%$$It means all the input energy has been converted to the kinetic energy that push our cars to move without any losses.
</div>

|              | Combustion Engine Cars | Electric Cars |
|--------------|------------------------|--------------|
| $$\eta_{e}$$ | 12-30%[(4)](#4) | 60-73%[(5)](#5)   |

The Combustion Engine are an ineffective machine, most of the energy are converted to thermal energy which basically means heat.

## Power to Wheels



# Less maintanace
Due to its much simpler design, Electric cars don't have the complicated engine with 6, 8 or 12 pistons; No more manual or automatic transmission [(3)](#3). As the result, the car don't need spark plugs, fuel injector, filters, exhaust ...

Instead electric cars have a battery and motors which are more durable and easier to repair or fix.

There are not much data on the cost to maintain an Electric car, but as pointed out in "Clean Disruption" by Tony Seba: Electric cars need 90-percent fewer reparis and maintaince works than combustion engines cars.

# Is it possible for a combustion engine to have 90% effiency?
No

In our combustion engine cars, we take the energy in form of gasoline or diesel, compress it with a little spark to cause an explosion so the piston could spin the crankshaft that connects to our wheels.



# Looking forward



# Funfact about the development of fossil fuel cars


# Is the electric cars the final answer?

##### (1)
The numbers were estimated by [United States Environmental Protection](https://www.epa.gov) for 55% city and 45% highway driving.

The number of L/100km estimated for electric cars are the equivalent liters of gas to generate electric to power the car to travel 100km.

All the data used in this post are available [here](https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/download.shtml).


##### (3)
A motor delivers its maximum torque even at zero RPM, so it doesn't need a transmission to keep the engine operate at the peak range of torque like combustion engine cars.

This is one of the reason why the Tesla Model S P100D could go from 0-100km/h in 2.3 seconds, the same league with Bugatti Chiron or Lamborghinis.
